OG0022116,Receptor regulated by TRXh5; essential in the modulation of spider mite Tetranychus urticae defence.

OG0022411,Receptor regulated by TRXh5; essential in the modulation of spider mite Tetranychus urticae defence.

OG0022684,Cysteine-rich protein that confers cadmium tolerance to yeast. Homologs are also found in rice,Brassica rapa and pine.

OG0023260,Negative regulator of auxin polar transport inhibitors. ABCG37 regulates auxin distribution and homeostasis in roots by excluding IBA from the root apex, but does not act directly in basipetal transport. ABCG37 and ABCG36 act redundantly at outermost root plasma membranes and, transport IBA out of the cells. Also involved in root transmembrane secretion of fluorescent phenolics involved in Fe uptake. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

OG0023449,Disease resistance protein (TIR-NBS-LRR class) family;(source:Araport11)
