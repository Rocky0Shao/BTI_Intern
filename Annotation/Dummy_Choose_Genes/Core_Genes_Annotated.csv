OG0000001,  Encodes a U12-type spliceosomal protein U11/U12-31K. Involved in U12 intron splicing via RNA chaperone activity and affects plant development.

OG0000003,  Encodes a putative sphingosine kinase (SphK) containing the five conserved domains (C1-C5) previously identified in SphKs.

OG0000006,  Cellulase (glycosyl hydrolase family 5) protein;(source:Araport11)
OG0000008,  Pectin methylesterase inhibitor AtPMEI2. Inactivates AtPPME1 in vitro. Localized to Brefeldin A-induced compartments and was found in FYVE-induced endosomal aggregates.
OG0000009,  Encodes EDM2 (enhanced downy mildew 2). The predicted protein bears typical features of transcriptional regulators. EDM2 contains two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS) two zinc-finger-like motifs a Proline-rich region and a large aspartic acid-rich region. Both zinc-finger-like stretches resemble the PHD (plant homeodomain) finger motif. Mutations in EDM2 comprise RPP7 mediated resistance against Hyaloperonospora parasitica isolate Hiks1 (HpHiks1). EDM2 may function as a direct or indirect regulator of RPP7 expression.

OG0000011,  PP1 Regulatory Subunit3. Interacts with members of the Type One Protein Phosphatases (TOPP) family.Facilitates the nuclear localization of TOPP4 which is required for its activity in mediating ABA responses.
OG0000012,  Plant U-box type E3 ubiquitin ligase (PUB).
OG0000013,  proline- glutamic acid/leucine-rich protein;(source:Araport11)
OG0000017,  Member of Membrin Gene Family. Encodes a Golgi-localized SNARE protein MEMB12. MEMB12 is a target of miR393b-mediated gene silencing during Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato infection. Loss of function of MEMB12 leads to increased exocytosis of an antimicrobial pathogenesis-related protein PR1.
OG0000018,  Encodes a cyclic GMP activated Ca2+-permeable cation channel in the plasma membrane of guard cells. Required for constitutive growth of root hairs as Ca2+-permeable channels.
OG0000022,  encodes a member of SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRK2) whose activity is activated by ionic (salt) and non-ionic (mannitol) osmotic stress.
OG0000026,  Mutant is defective in meiosis and produces abnormal microspores. Encodes a BRCT-domain-containing protein that could be specific to the meiotic cell cycle and that plays a crucial role in some DNA repair events independent of SPO11 DSB recombination repair.

OG0000037,  Mutant is defective in meiosis and produces abnormal microspores. Encodes a BRCT-domain-containing protein that could be specific to the meiotic cell cycle and that plays a crucial role in some DNA repair events independent of SPO11 DSB recombination repair.
OG0000038,  Encodes AtSPO11-1; one of the three Arabidopsis homologues of the archaeal DNA topoisomerase VIA subunit (topo VIA). Required for meiotic recombination. AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2 have overlapping functions (i.e. both required for meiotic recombination) whereas AtSPO11-3 functions in DNA replication. AtSPO11-1 accumulates in foci in early G2. At 1 h post-S phase; no foci are observed; but by 3 h a majority (80%) of meiocytes at this time point contain >50 foci. However; by 5 h; AtSPO11-1 foci are no longer detectable. This suggests that the protein undergoes a rapid cycle of accumulation and disappearance in meiocytes over a period of between 1 and 5 h post-S phase.
OG0000040,  Single-stranded nucleic acid binding R3H protein;(source:Araport11)
OG0000042,  CAP-3D is a subunit of condensin. It a target of MMD1 regulation and also involved in meiotic chromosome condensation. Mutants have reduced fertility. Required for the correct spatial relationship between centromeres and rDNA arrays.
OG0000043,  A member of ARF GTPase family. A thaliana has 21 members of this family; known to be essential for vesicle coating and uncoating and functions in GTP-binding. The gene is shown to play a role in cell division; cell expansion and cellulose production using antisense construct. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
