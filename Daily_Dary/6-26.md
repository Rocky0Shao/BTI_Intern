today first day in lab.
talked about the other applicants.
talked highly of mukun.
maria's lecture of fungi phaosphata
basic description of project:
gene-based pan-genome construction of cucumber:
    -Identify pan and core genes: Utilize available genomic data to identify the pan and core genes within the cucumber genomes.
    -Calculate PAV frequency: Determine the presence-absence variation (PAV) frequency of genes across the genomes.
    -Selection analysis: Investigate the selection of gene PAVs during the cucumber breeding process.
    -Enrichment analysis: Conduct enrichment analysis of the identified genes to uncover any significant biological processes or pathways.
