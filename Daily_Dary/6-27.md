2. learn some basic linux command line such as: cd, ls, mkdir, cp, mv, rm, vim

3. count the gene number in 39 protein files.

4. draw a histogram in of the gene number in R

bash to: 
    traverse all file in dir
    count occurance of ">"
    make it into txt containing:
        2 column, 1 column gene name, 1 col protein num
Excell read it.

use R to draw histogram:    
    cvt txt to csv
    read it using r
    use ggplot to maek histogram

challenge:
    x, y axis flipped 
        -> correct in coce
    scale of y axis poort ->
        first ask chatgpt to solve, didn't work
        then google the problem on stack overflow, finally worked. 
            use cord_cartician(ylim), not just ylim.

next step:
    make csv to 3 line excll format
      -> easy done
    make histogram better looking.
      -> easy done
