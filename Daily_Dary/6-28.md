kept making the bar graph look nicer.

I also read some articles to get more background info about the project:
    1. Graph-based pan-genome reveals structural and sequence variations related to agronomic traits and domestication in cucumber

    2. A genomic variation map provides insights into the genetic basis of cucumber domestication and diversity

    

    3. Super-pangenome analyses highlight genomic diversity and structural variation across wild and cultivated tomato species

    4. A graph-based genome and pan-genome variation of the model plant Setaria

    5. Pangenome analysis reveals genomic variations associated with domestication traits in broomcorn millet

    

    6. Genome evolution and diversity of wild and cultivated potatoes

    7. Phylogenomic discovery of deleterious mutations facilitates hybrid potato breeding

    8. Graph pangenome captures missing heritability and empowers tomato breeding

    9. Phylogenomic analyses provide insights into primate evolution
(Also during luch watched Trump vs Biden presidential debate lol)

I'm trying to copy the summer folder from server to local machine:
 scp -r rocky@132.236.156.165:~/summer C:\Users\Rocky\Desktop\BTI\Raw_Data
 - I first typed this in server cmd, it copied empty dir from my laptoop to the server.
 = then I find out I have to open cmd on my local machine, and type this in cmd:
    scp rocky@132.236.156.165:/data/rocky/summer/*.fa "C:/Users/Rocky/Desktop/BTI/Raw_Data"
