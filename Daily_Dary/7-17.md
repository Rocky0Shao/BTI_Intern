Morning went to Warron hall to listen to grand-school application with undergrads

then I'm going to run AHRD:

nohup java -Xmx10g -jar /data/rocky/pre_annotation/ahrd.jar /data/rocky/pre_annotation/run_diamond/input.yml > run_diamond.log 2>&1 &


Opps, AHRD gave NullPointer 
lol, the file path isn't right
