Today first find out list of genes that have high frequency in both cultivated and wild species, and save the names into a file

then made enrichment graph in R

Sadly, no significant enrichment were found.

then use the blast2go app's default enrichment method to make enrichment graph, withe previous generated name list

It made enichment results
filter out rows with no significance
paste them together

in the afternoon make enrichment bar graph, so that the x axis is the num of references, y axis is the Go.Name, and it's color change wiht the P value
