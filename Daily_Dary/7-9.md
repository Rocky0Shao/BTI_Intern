Run Orthofinder on differnt -I cluster settings.

summer -> -I 1.5
summer2 -> -I 10
summer3 -> -I 30
summer4 -> -I 40

for each tsv file generated, I first make separate PAV matrix, then calculate how many genes are in 1 col.

now I want to copy the tsv files into my local machine:
    scp rocky@132.236.156.165:/data/rocky/GeneMatrix/Matrix/*.tsv "C:\Users\Fei Lab\Desktop\Intern-Work"

then sum all cols up.
    scp rocky@132.236.156.165:/data/rocky/GeneMatrix/Matrix/Sums/*.tsv "C:\Users\Fei Lab\Desktop\Intern-Work"

-I 30 have issues.
rerunL
 nohup orthofinder -I 30 -f summer3/ -t 80 > summer3/Ortho_Log.txt 2>&1 &


made bar graph, x axis is gene num, y axis is num of 1's in the matrix generated by orthogroup


now make PAV, first col is orthogroup, second col is num of 1 in the row, 3rd col is frequency.
    scp rocky@132.236.156.165:/data/rocky/GeneMatrix/Matrix/PAV/*.tsv "C:\Users\Fei Lab\Desktop\Intern-Work\PAV"

make histogram chart of PAV frequency
the 100% frequency have a lot, so change y axis to log scale, 10^0,1,2,3,4
Then try to insert pie chart represent the frequency of each gene.
