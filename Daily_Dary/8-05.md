Today is a Monday, and I'll be presenting the poster on Thursday!

In the morning 吴珊师姐 gave our room some peaches! (Although it was really sour lol)

I hurried and finished the final draft of the poster yesterday morning (it was pretty slow)

Thankfully my mentor Xuebo clutched and saved my poster, and Dr.Fei revised it again, and it's ready to print!

Shout out to my mentor Xuebo

Xuebo also made me delicious 花生酱拌面, and there's plenty left so I have garunteed lunch for tmr, yay!
